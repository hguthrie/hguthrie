## Hi there 👋

As an accomplished technical writer, I am always eager to explore emerging technologies and systems functionality, which fuels my passion for developing effective content strategies. My interest in productive organization techniques and information architectures drives me to create clear and structured content that enhances user understanding and engagement.

- 🔭 I am exploring new opportunities. Visit my [GitHub Pages](https://hguthrie.github.io) for a summary of recent job roles.
- 🌱 I am currently learning more about AI tools that help us set goals and manage our workload.
- 👀 I enjoy being an SME, solving problems, and optimizing time and content.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love to read. Books expand my world and fuel my imagination. Right now, I am reading some old classics by Mark Twain, Agatha Christie, and Morley.
